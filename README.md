##ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier â€” Bank Marketing Dataset
----
##ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.
The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The project covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insight generation using machine learning techniques.
